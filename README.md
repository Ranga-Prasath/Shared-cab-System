## 📋 About

This is a **demo project** for my **Design Thinking & Innovation** course in college. It showcases a shared cab-booking system designed for students and daily commuters — emphasizing **safety**, **affordability**, and **real-time tracking**.

The app demonstrates how design thinking methodology (Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test) can be applied to solve the real-world problem of expensive solo cab rides, especially during late-night commutes.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

> Solo cab rides are expensive for students. Existing ride-sharing platforms don't optimize for route overlap or provide adequate safety features for night-time travel.

### 💡 Solution

A shared cab platform that:
- **Matches riders** with 35%+ route overlap within a 15-minute departure window
- **Splits fares** automatically (up to 67% savings)
- **Activates night safety mode** (9 PM – 6 AM) with SOS, safe arrival PIN, and emergency contacts
- **Tracks trips live** on a map with route deviation alerts

### State Management

**Riverpod** providers manage all app state:

| Provider | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `currentUserProvider` | Active user session |
| `currentRideRequestProvider` | In-progress ride request |
| `activeTripProvider` | Ongoing trip state + status |
| `effectiveNightModeProvider` | Auto/manual night mode |
| `routeDeviationProvider` | Active route deviation alert |
| `recurringRidesProvider` | Saved ride schedules |
| `gpsTrackingActiveProvider` | GPS tracking status |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Framework** | Flutter 3.11 (Web) |
| **Language** | Dart 3.11 |
| **State** | Riverpod |
| **Navigation** | GoRouter |
| **Maps** | flutter_map + OpenStreetMap (free, no API key) |
| **GPS** | Geolocator (browser geolocation API) |
| **Animations** | flutter_animate |
| **Fonts** | Google Fonts (Inter) |
| **IDs** | UUID v4 |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK ≥ 3.11.0
- Chrome browser (for web demo)

### Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Ranga-Prasath-22/shared-cab-system.git
cd shared-cab-system

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on Chrome
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Demo Flow

```
Sign up / Login → Home
  → Create Ride → Select Pickup & Drop → Find Matches
    → Accept Match → Trip Status (Map View!)
      → Watch cab animate along route
      → See deviation alert at ~60%
      → Complete Trip → Rate Riders
  → My Schedules → Create recurring ride
  → Profile → Toggle night mode, manage contacts
```

## 📊 Design Thinking Process

| Phase | What We Did |
|-------|-------------|
| **Empathize** | Interviewed 20+ college students about cab-sharing pain points |
| **Define** | "Students need affordable, safe shared rides with route-compatible co-riders" |
| **Ideate** | Brainstormed 15+ features; prioritized by impact vs. feasibility |
| **Prototype** | Built this Flutter web app as a functional prototype |
| **Test** | Demonstrated with mock data; validated UI/UX with peers |

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is an **academic demo project** built for coursework evaluation. The app now uses a real Flutter client, Firebase auth/Firestore flows where configured, and a deterministic matching pipeline, but several safety actions remain **demo-only UX**: the app does not automatically message emergency contacts or dispatch law enforcement. GPS tracking uses browser geolocation and falls back to a map center while waiting for a live fix.
